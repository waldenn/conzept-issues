# explore
Explore is a (currently closed source) web app aimed at effective and enjoyable topic explorations, beyond the main subjects of Wikischool. Explore is ideal for self-study purposes.

# open source
I'm in the process of researching if some regular funding can be achieved to allow me to opensource this tool. Stay tuned!
